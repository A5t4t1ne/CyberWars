# Secure Project

This repo is meant to contain everything CTF-environment-related.


## Installation

Everything needed to create the CTF environment is inside the docker containers. So you should be able to start and build it with docker-compose and everything should be up and running.

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker-compose

### Docker environment

download the repo and start the environment:

```
https://github.com/Jave01/secproj.git
cd secproj/docker_stuff
docker-compose up -d --build
```

note that docker needs root-privileges.
