Yesterday Peter Quill aka "Starlord" (how did he even come up with this stupid name) randomly walked up to me and whispered in my ear:
I completely trust you, thats why I tell you my biggest secret: "Y0u_m1gh7_kn0w_m3_45_Starlord"
I have no clue what he meant with that but I am gonna hide this secret anyways, just in case.
